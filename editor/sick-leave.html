                <p>One of McDonald's values is to "invest in all the people our success rests on." But in the video above, a shift manager at a McDonald's restaurant in Kansas City, Mo., asks why a company that earned $5.3 billion last year can't guarantee paid sick leave for all of its workers, especially during the coronavirus outbreak.  And while the relief bill President Trump signed Wednesday night expands paid sick leave, McDonald's lobbied against parts of the legislation. The new law only guarantees sick leave to 20 percent of private-sector workers &mdash; and many of the company's franchise workers get nothing. Would you want to get your next meal from a restaurant where workers can't stay home while sick?</p>
