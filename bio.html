                <p>I'm a video editor and documentary filmmaker. Previously I cut a video about vaccine hesitancy in the Ozarks which was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding News Analysis: Editorial and Opinion. I've also edited videos about income inequality, a lack of PPE for healthcare workers, and a story about grief during Covid-19. A video I edited about a lack of paid sick leave at McDonald's for its franchise workers was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding News Analysis: Editorial and Opinion. The New Essentials of French Cooking guide I edited at NYT Cooking won a James Beard award for Innovative Storytelling. I also edited a story about content moderation, and another about gun violence. In Detroit I documented protestors outside the Dearborn Heights police station following the murder of Renisha McBride.</p>
                <p>I was the cinematographer on the feature length documentary treasure, directed by dream hampton. The film premiered at the 2015 Los Angeles Film Festival. I co-edited A Girl Named C, a feature documentary directed by Emily Kassie. The film premiered at the 2018 Austin Film Festival. I shot and edited the music video QueenS. NPR named it one of the most stylish music videos of 2012. I edited the music video Cutting Ice To Snow.</p>
                <p>Born and raised in Philadelphia, I have a BFA in filmmaking from New York University. After NYU, I co-created, produced, directed, and edited the first three seasons of Brothers Green, a cooking show based in Brooklyn. A huge fan and supporter of The Bronx Documentary Center, I'm inspired by their mission in teaching and encouraging students to learn about image making.</p>
